Software for (cryo/RT) volume-EM acquisition. It allows to acquire the big volume in constant high quality.  

Key features:
- Usage of deep learning model for segmentation of region of interest. The segmented region is used for:
  - Resolution calculation ([siFRC](https://github.com/prabhatkc/siFRC) or others)
  - Autofocusing, autostigmator, auto-lens alignment (multiple criterions and sweeping strategies)
  - Drift correction & FoV optimization (template matching, or segmented region centering)
  - Auto contrast-brightness (whole image or segmented region)
- Email attention
- Works with ThermoFisher Autoscript. Support of [OpenFIBSEM](https://github.com/DeMarcoLab/fibsem) for other vendors (Tescan, Zeiss) is planned.
